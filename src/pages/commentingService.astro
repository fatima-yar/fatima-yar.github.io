      I developed a full-stack commenting service designed to seamlessly integrate with blog posts, enabling users to add, edit, delete, and reply to comments. This project was initially created to gain comprehensive experience in both frontend and backend development, this service is now successfully integrated into the 
      <LinkText href="/brdg">BRDG</LinkText>
      platform.
