      <h3>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        As a full-stack developer, I'm eager to have a solid knowledge of both
        front-end and back-end development. After gaining some experience in the
        market, initially as an intern and then as a junior developer, I want to
        expand my knowledge in project management to be able to lead a team. I
        also have another idea in the back of my mind. I have a strong
        background in 3D visualization with various software and a bit
        experience using Unity. I was thinking of learning C# and eventually
        starting to develop games in my spare time.

        2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p>
        My strength is that I can learn easily and adapt myself to new
        technologies. It's very exciting for me to step into a new world! I have
        a bit of curiosity and explore more about a concept that I’m learning. I
        don’t know if I should count this as a strength or a limitation because
        sometimes, I overwhelm myself with lots of tabs open in my browser and
        dedicate my time to features that aren't required in the programme.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my limitations is the difficulty in asking questions due to my
        past bad experiences. I try to find a solution on my own and waste a lot
        of time on that. If I don’t have any other option and cannot find a
        solution, then I start sharing my problem on Discord. Also, I don't want
        to consider myself a perfectionist, but sometimes I try to fix every
        tiny problem, even when they are not actual problems. For example, I
        feel the size of the buttons in my blog isn’t fulfilling. I try to
        resize them, then I realize I don’t have their color. After trying many
        colors, I feel that their font needs to change, and then I notice they
        don’t have a shadow on them. Oh! When the mouse hovers on them, they
        should change color

        3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Firstly, communication skills. I am passionate about improving my
        English proficiency, both verbally and in writing. Next, teamwork
        skills. While I have experience working in teams, I recognize that the
        tech field often requires even stronger collaborative abilities compared
        to interior design. Additionally, I need to enhance my time management
        skills. Lastly, networking is an essential skill in every field in the
        market!

        4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include: o An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
        work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives o What you will do when things are
        building up and starting to get to you
      </h3>
      <p>
        At the beginning of each Sprint, I review all the Sprint lessons and
        their time box. Then, I plan out my days accordingly for each task. For
        instance, in Sprint 2, I noticed that it required more time compared to
        Sprint 1. For example, it was in 10 hours to learn HTML and CSS on
        Freecodecamp in the time box. Therefore, I allocated a day and a half to
        complete it, and did the same for other lessons. I admit that I tend to
        feel anxious when I see fellow learners completing their tasks within
        the first two days, while it takes me the entire week to catch up.
        However, I've learned to manage my stress by using time boxing and
        tracking my progress. This ensures that I learn effectively and complete
        my homework assignments within a reasonable timeframe.

        5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <p>
        As I wrote above, I have difficulty to ask problem, for example I
        couldn’t see my changes in css in my browser. Firstly, I thought I
        didn’t link my css to html, or I assigned another css file into my html.
        I searched online and waste lots of time because I thought it was my bad
        and I have to fix it. After wasting about 1hr, finally I asked in
        Discord and Dave helped me out.

        They are super friendly and knowledgeable. If we ask a question they

        these and they are better than I thought!
