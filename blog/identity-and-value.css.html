      <h2></h2>

      <div class="position">
        <h3>1.	Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, 
          the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now. </h2>
        <p>
          I saw my friends talking behind a classmate's back. 
          I said no and told them to respect his privacy. 
          I asked them to imagine he was there, how do you feel if he heard you? It was hard, 
          but I stuck to what I believe. Gossiping is toxic. Some friends felt weird; others agreed. 
          I hope I made them think. Being nice is important. I lost some friends' liking but gained self-respect. 
          Doing the right thing feels good.

        <h3>2.	Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
        <p>
          I believe that a significant part of one's identity comes from culture and family. They can shape a large portion of personality, 
          even if one may not want it. Culture and the people around me have had a significant impact on my values, such as kindness, compassion, 
          and helping others, as well as fostering a sense of conservatism. Over the years, 
          I have endeavored to reinforce positive values while minimizing negative ones.

        <h3>3.	Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
        <p>
          My 4 top strengths are kindness, creativity, love of learning and teamwork. 
          I believe that they have a significant impact of my learning journey. 
          Because all we need is to learning new things and collaborate with others. 
          If you love learning and interact with people, the path will be easier for you.

      <div class="position">
        <h3>4.	Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
        If we know our limitation, it will be easier to address them during our journey. I have to work more on my stress and anxiety. 
        Sometimes I need to focus more on my task. Daydreaming and worries about the past and future distract me from learning some times.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="position">
        <h3>5.	Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
          Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, 
          and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
        <p>
          In my pervious work place, we were a team of four but had a limited deadline on a big project. One of the team members 
          didn’t propose any idea in the meeting and stayed silence. We thought that she might not interested or didn’t want to collaborate. 
          During the break time I talked to her and found out her mother is sick and she couldn’t concentrate of her tasks. 
          I suggested to work together on her tasks and help her to focus more and stop her anxiety during the working time.
