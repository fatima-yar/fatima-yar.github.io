          <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning? </h3>
          <p style="margin-top: 20px;"></p>
          <p>To be more patient with learning; it's not necessary to work unlimited hours without breaks.
            To be kinder to myself; many behaviors are normal, but I used to blame myself a lot!.
            And I've discovered that we can shape our brains at any age! Learning about ways to increase my neuroplasticity has been fascinating.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 40px;"></p>
            <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming? </h3>
          <p style="margin-top: 20px;"></p>
          <p>Values, empathy, and self-awareness help us become more aware, facilitating solution finding and fair communication with others.
             A closed mind limits out-of-the-box thinking, while lack of communication slows down problem understanding.
             Additionally, without self-awareness, we struggle to recognize our strengths and weaknesses.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 40px;"></p>
            <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning? </h3>
          <p style="margin-top: 20px;"></p>
          <p>The concepts were so interesting to me, and I was surprised when I studied about neuroplasticity.
             I had always thought that our learning skills gradually decrease as we get older. This relates to what you think about yourself.
              If you believe that your learning skills are diminishing gradually, you may try to avoid learning new things,
               and you shape your brain accordingly. Therefore, you would not be as smart as you were in the past.<br>
            However, if you know that you can shape your brain and make it stronger, you won't give up on learning.
            
            <p style="margin-top: 40px;"></p>
            <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning? </h3>
          <p style="margin-top: 20px;"></p>
          <p>I can say listening and looping because I did not do that. Everyday I postponed it for the next dayâ€¦
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 40px;"></p>
            <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course? </h3>
          <p style="margin-top: 20px;"></p>
          <p>Having strong foundational skills is crucial, even more so than technical abilities. Someone with strong core skills can be a better match for
             a job in a company. That's because work isn't just about knowing how to use technology. If a team member lacks core skills, they can harm
              the entire team,
             and this is widely recognized. When people have strong core skills, they have a better chance of getting hired.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 40px;"></p>
            <h3>WDoes the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer. </h3>
          <p style="margin-top: 20px;"></p>
          <p>No, not at all. I'm excited for the bootcamp to start and I can further develop my core learning alongside others.
             I plan to use the skills I learned and enhance them through collaboration with fellow participants.
            </p>
