        <h3><span class="quot"> My Non-technical friend:</span><br>Do you know JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS? </h3>

        <p>
          Imagine you're building a website – it's like constructing a digital house.<br>

          First, you need a blueprint, right? That's your HTML. It lays out the structure of your site, like the walls, windows, and doors.<br>
          
          But just having the structure isn't enough. You need to make it look good too! 
          That's where CSS comes in. It's like hiring an interior designer to paint the walls, 
          add curtains, and make everything visually appealing.<br>

          
          But what about functionality? That's where JavaScript works its magic. <br>
          It's like having a wizard in your house. With JavaScript, you can make things interactive – 
          like pressing a button to open and close windows, or changing the color of elements with a touch. 
          You can even add features like a remote control to move elements around the page, making the experience dynamic and engaging.<br>

          So, just like in our digital house, with HTML as the structure, CSS as the interior design,
           and JavaScript as the magical functionality, your website becomes not just functional but also 
           enjoyable and interactive. It's like turning a plain house into a smart, futuristic home.<br>
          COULD WE BE ANYMORE HAPPIER ?!

          <h3><span class="quot"> My Non-technical friend:</span><br>Explain control flow and loops for me! </h3>
          <p>Consider the process of going out to buy groceries. Imagine you first create a list of the items you need. Then, you drive to the supermarket, grab a trolley, and proceed to pick up each item one by one. 
            If the first item is available, you pick it, otherwise, you may look for an alternative brand. Finally, if they've run out of that product, you skip that item and move on to the next one. You won’t wait a week until they restock it.
            At the end, you head to the cashier to pay for all the items. (Loops) <br>
            
            Notice how each step in this process must be completed in a specific order.<br> 
            Can you pay for the items before selecting them? <strong>No!</strong> <br>
            Can you select items before even arriving at the supermarket? <strong>No!</strong> <br>
            Every action is dependent on the completion of the previous step. <br>
            This step-by-step process reflects how actions in 
            programming are carried out in a set order, following certain conditions or rules.

            <h3><span class="quot"> My Non-technical friend:</span><br>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.  </h3>
            <p>
              Let's revisit the house we built in the first question and find something you bought in the second one!
            </p>
            <p>This house includes a kitchen. Within the kitchen, there's a pantry with shelves, each stocked with various groceries and items.</p>
            <p>Now, if I wanted to find the cocoa powder, you would advise me to go to the kitchen, open the pantry, and locate it on the second shelf. This analogy mirrors the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
            <p>In the context of a web page, the DOM serves a similar purpose. If you wish to alter text within a paragraph or assign an action to a button click, you would utilize the DOM to locate these elements (such as the paragraph or button) and then implement your desired changes or actions.</p>
            <p>Thus, the DOM essentially functions as a tool for computer programs, like JavaScript, to comprehend and interact with the elements on a web page.</p>
            <p><strong>This is the DOM Hierarchy</strong></p>
            <image id="house" src="/blog/image/DOM-Hierarchy.png" alt="house"></image>
            <p>
              In order to modify elements within an HTML document, we utilize the Document Object Model (DOM), which serves as a programming interface for web content. Rather than requiring a 'direction', the DOM provides methods to precisely target and manipulate specific elements. This can be done by selecting elements based on various attributes such as tag names, IDs, or classes. For instance, if we have a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element with an ID attribute like this: 
              <code>&lt;div id="myDiv"&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/div&gt;</code>, we can employ JavaScript to select this element by its ID and alter its content. The method <code>document.getElementById("myDiv")</code> selects the element with the ID 'myDiv', allowing us to subsequently change its properties or content as needed.
            
              </p>
          </div>

              <h3><span class="quot"> My Non-technical friend:</span><br>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
              <p>Are you still in the kitchen?
              </p>
              <p>Great! Arrays are like shelves in the pantry; you can find items based on their position. For example, on the second shelf from the left, you have sugar, cocoa powder, flour, and shredded coconut! So if you ask me to hand you the second item, it’s always the cocoa powder!</p>
              <p>Objects are like labeled containers in the pantry. You have a drawer labeled "spices" in your pantry. If you open it, you can find many spices like chili flakes, oregano, thyme, or dill. But how do you find which one is oregano? By reading its label!!</p>
              <p>So, with arrays, you locate items by their position, while with objects, you find them by their labels.</p>

                  <p>In programming, a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It takes input(s) as parameters, performs some operations on them and returns a result. Functions are used to organize code, make it more readable, and avoid repetitive tasks. </p>
