        <h3>1.What is Emotional Intelligence? </h3>
        <p>
          Emotional Intelligence (EI) means knowing and controlling your own feelings while understanding others' emotions. 
          It includes five main parts: knowing yourself,
           controlling yourself, staying motivated, being empathetic, and having good social skills.

          <h3>2.How is EQ different to IQ? </h3>
          <p>
            Your EQ is about how well you handle emotions and interact socially. 
            This includes understanding others' feelings, controlling your own emotions, 
            and staying motivated. On the other hand, IQ measures your cognitive and intellectual abilities, 
            such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and memory.
          IQ is an inherent characteristic, while EQ is something that can be developed.

            <h3>3.Why is EQ important? </h3>
            <p>
              Emotional intelligence helps you make better friendships, do well in school and jobs, 
              and reach your dreams in life and work. It also helps you understand your feelings, 
              act on your plans, and choose what's important to you wisely.
