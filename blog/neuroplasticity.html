        <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people. </h3>

        

        <p>
          Plasticity refers to the brain's malleability or ability to change; it does not imply that the brain is plastic.<p> Neuro refers to neurons, the nerve cells that are the building blocks of the brain and nervous system. Thus, neuroplasticity allows nerve cells to change or adjust.</p>


<p>Neuroplasticity means that people can and do change. By changing how existing brain cells function, we can make healthy behaviors and positive emotions easier to experience.</p>
<p>Behavioral and thought patterns are made up of groups of brain cells that form neural pathways. The more frequently you engage in a thought or behavior, the stronger the neural pathway and the easier that thought or behavior becomes.</p>
<p>For example, consider someone with Depression. They may automatically think things like, “I’m such a failure.” That’s because the neural pathways for negative self-talk have become strong after living with depression. On the other hand, thoughts like, “I’m worthy of love,” can be difficult because pathways of self-love have become weaker.</p>
<p>Neuroplasticity can change all of that. You can strengthen neural pathways that serve you and lessen those that don’t. Not only can you change the pathways of your existing neurons, but you can grow new ones. Changing your brain is not easy, but it’s absolutely worth the effort.</p>
<p>Activating brain pathways that enable you to cope well leads to adaptive neuroplasticity. It sharpens your cognitive function, balances your mood, and keeps you motivated. But letting the stress get to you can give you maladaptive neuroplasticity, leading to persistent brain fog, depression, anxiety, and loss of motivation.</p>

            <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity? </h3>
            <p>
              <ol>
              	<li><strong>Fuel Your Brain:</strong> Your brain, though small in proportion, demands a significant portion of your diet. Opt for snacks like walnuts, blueberries, and avocado, and prioritize Vitamin D and magnesium for enhanced neural pathways.</li>
              	<li><strong>Take Power Naps:</strong> A short afternoon nap, around 20 minutes, boosts neuroplasticity potential by fostering growth of dendritic spines, crucial connectors in your brain.</li>
              	<li><strong>End the Work Day:</strong> Incorporate a "close the day" ritual to unwind and reflect, signaling to your brain it's time to relax and fostering neuroplasticity.</li>
              	<li><strong>Expand Vocabulary:</strong> Learn a new word daily to ignite numerous neural pathways and improve cognitive abilities.</li>
              	<li><strong>Challenge Your Dominance:</strong> Exercise your non-dominant hand to form new neural connections, such as brushing your teeth with your non-dominant hand.</li>
              	<li><strong>Juggle for Brain Health:</strong> Practice juggling to enhance neuroplasticity, even during short breaks at work.</li>
              	<li><strong>Play Chess:</strong> Engage in chess, a game known to boost neuroplasticity, online or offline, for mental stimulation and growth.</li>
              	<li><strong>Utilize Mnemonic Devices:</strong> Employ mnemonic drills like rhymes or formulas to enhance brain connectivity and establish positive pathways.</li>
              	<li><strong>Embrace Team Mindfulness:</strong> Incorporate group meditation to promote neuroplasticity and foster calmness, passion, and awareness among team members.</li>

                <h3>•	Discuss what it is and why it is relevant. </h3>
        <p>Growth mindset describes a way of viewing challenges and setbacks. People who have a 
          growth mindset believe that even if they struggle with certain skills, 
          their abilities aren’t set in stone. They think that with work, their skills can improve over time. </p>
        <p>People with the opposite belief — that abilities are what they are and won’t change — have a fixed mindset.
             They think their skills won’t improve no matter how hard they try.</p>
        <p>Having a growth mindset can have real benefits. It helps people reframe their approach to challenges and stay motivated to work to improve skills. 
              Instead of thinking “I can’t do this,” they think “I can’t do it yet.”</p>
        <p>The theory of growth mindset isn’t new. It came out of research by psychologist Carol Dweck and her colleagues. 
          Their research focused on kids. But the concept applies to adults, too. </p>
        <p>Growth mindset isn’t something that people are always born with. Kids and adults can develop the 
          belief that things that are hard to do now may not always be hard.</p>

                  <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you? </h3>
      <p>They didn’t teach us these concepts in schools, and unfortunately, I have never searched or read about these topics. 
        The traditional thought has always been in the back of my mind (the brain is solid and never changes).
        I believe that this is a fantastic truth, and everyone has to know about it. It can change people's mindset and their lives!</p>
      <p>When I face a challenge, I understand that my brain needs to form connections between neurons, and this process may take time. 
        I won't let negative thoughts label me as dumb or a failure. 
        Instead, I see every challenge as an opportunity for my brain to grow.</p>

<div class="flexbox-container">
  <div class="flexbox-item">

    <h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.   </h3>
<p>As I prepared to start my journey at DevAcademy, I couldn't ignore the gap between my school days and now. 
  I worried that learning might not come as easily as it did when I was younger.</p>
<p>Learning about neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset changed everything. Knowing that our brains can adapt and grow with practice gave me a new perspective. 
  It's not about comparing myself to my past self but about embracing growth at any age.</p>
<p>Now, I'm more motivated and brave. Instead of being held back by self-doubt, I see challenges as opportunities to grow. 
  Each lesson learned makes me stronger and more confident in my journey toward success</p>
