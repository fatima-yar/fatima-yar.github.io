          <p>
            When I want to solve a problem in coding, I use a mix of pseudocode and talking to my rubber duck to the  problems. First, 
            I describe the problem in simple English, as if I'm explaining it to my duck (who understands Persian). Then, I write down steps to solve it,
             like making a recipe (that's the pseudocode part). My duck is always ready to listen to each step in pseudocode.
             I try out my solution, fix any mistakes, using console.log() , checking find mistakes  and keep trying until it works!
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 20px;"></p>
          <p>For example, I was struggling with the last event, Event 4 - "We Built this City." The first thing I
             needed to do was understand the question. Yeah, I explained the question to my rubber duck. <small><em>Please keep this between us;
             I don’t have a physical one. I have a rubber duck inside my heart, and it’s always with me.</em></small></p>
             <p style="margin-top: 20px;"></p>
          <p>Anyway, I found out what I needed to do, but I still had a bit of trouble with writing the syntax. That's when I turned to Google for help.
               I searched for the solution I wanted to apply. I found some helpful insights on JavaScript objects on different websites. Then, I wrote my code.
               It was so exciting for me, especially when all three tests passed!
               Oh… "should return an athlete with a win method." What? Everything seemed normal…<br>
               Let me see the error in the test. It was just a tiny space in my string. Yay! It passed!!
               
             </p>
             <p style="margin-top: 20px;"></p>

          <p>During my problem-solving in this exercise, I learned not to panic. The first and most important part is to understand the problem!</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 20px;"></p>
          <p><em>I wanna admit something</em>
            I usually ask my questions on Discord when I desperately need help, and honestly, 
            there are always knowledgeable instructors and classmates available to assist. 
            I'm truly impressed and thankful for their support. However, I think due to my past bad experiences with asking questions,
             my inner judgmental voice sometimes prevents me from asking initially. But I've learned it's important not to let it hold me back!</p>
